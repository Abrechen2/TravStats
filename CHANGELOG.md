- Admin page refactored to sidebar layout
- All plain browser checkboxes replaced with styled `.checkbox` class

### Fixed

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Prettier formatter for frontend TypeScript/TSX/CSS (`format` and `format:check` scripts)
- ts-prune dead code detection scripts in frontend and backend (`dead-code` script)
- Vitest coverage reporting with v8 provider and regression thresholds (`test:coverage` script)
- ruff.toml Python linter config; auto-fixed 220 issues in training scripts
- bandit security config (`.bandit.yml`) for Python script scanning
- License whitelist (`LICENSE_WHITELIST.txt`) covering all project dependencies
- Pre-commit hooks: trailing whitespace, YAML/JSON validation, secret detection, ruff, Prettier
- GitHub Actions CI workflow: backend (typecheck + lint + test with Postgres), frontend (typecheck + lint + format + coverage), Python (ruff + bandit)
- Dev setup scripts (`scripts/setup-dev.sh` and `scripts/setup-dev.ps1`) for onboarding
- Smoke test script (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`) for post-deploy verification

### Changed
- Docker security hardening: `cap_drop: ALL` + minimal `cap_add`, `no-new-privileges`, log rotation, and resource limits on `app`, `db`, and `ollama` services

### Fixed
- Removed unnecessary `CAP_SETUID`/`CAP_SETGID` from app container (root can setuid without them)
- Corrected pre-commit prettier hook entry to properly forward filenames (`npx --prefix frontend prettier --write`)
